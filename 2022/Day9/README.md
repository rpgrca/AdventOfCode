## Day 9: Rope Bridge

This rope bridge creaks as you walk along it. You aren't sure how old it is, or whether it can even support your weight.

It seems to support the Elves just fine, though. The bridge spans a gorge which was carved out by the massive river far below you.

You step carefully; as you do, the ropes stretch and twist. You decide to distract yourself by modeling rope physics; maybe you can even figure out where _not_ to step.

Consider a rope with a knot at each end; these knots mark the _head_ and the _tail_ of the rope. If the head moves far enough away from the tail, the tail is pulled toward the head.

Due to nebulous reasoning involving **Planck lengths**, you should be able to model the positions of the knots on a two-dimensional grid. Then, by following a hypothetical _series of motions_ (your puzzle input) for the head, you can determine how the tail will move.
