## Day 25: Full of Hot Air

As the expedition finally reaches the extraction point, several large **hot air balloons** drift down to meet you. Crews quickly start unloading the equipment the balloons brought: many hot air balloon kits, some fuel tanks, and a _fuel heating machine_.

The fuel heating machine is a new addition to the process. When this mountain was a volcano, the ambient temperature was more reasonable; now, it's so cold that the fuel won't work at all without being warmed up first.

The Elves, seemingly in an attempt to make the new machine feel welcome, have already attached a pair of **googly eyes** and started calling it "Bob".

To heat the fuel, Bob needs to know the total amount of fuel that will be processed ahead of time so it can correctly calibrate heat output and flow rate. This amount is simply the _sum_ of the fuel requirements of all of the hot air balloons, and those fuel requirements are even listed clearly on the side of each hot air balloon's burner.

You assume the Elves will have no trouble adding up some numbers and are about to go back to figuring out which balloon is yours when you get a tap on the shoulder. Apparently, the fuel requirements use numbers written in a format the Elves don't recognize; predictably, they'd like your help deciphering them.

You make a list of all of the fuel requirements (your puzzle input), but you don't recognize the number format either.
